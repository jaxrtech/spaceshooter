spaceshooter
============

A fun Flash project of a quick space shoot-'em-up game for a school project.

It comes with a simple framework to manage adding and removing event listeners and what not.
There is quite a bit more that could be added and improved, but its a great starting point
to learning more with dealing with Flash with ActionScript 3 and game development in general.
